# July 22nd: PCB and Schematic

I had already once strated to make this project so it was already pretty easy this time becase i already knew the schematic without having to check anything

So i did the schematic and made it really clean not really neceseray but i really like it super clean even if the thing is really simple.
Then i moved on to the PCB this was a bit harder but it was really easy too i just used the same postion as last time to put the usb c and the pin headers but changed the resistors placement to a better placement then wired everything up and added ground pour and a bit of silk screen!
